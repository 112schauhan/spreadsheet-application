- `Cell.tsx` - Formula processing in cell editing

**How to Test**:
1. Select cell B8 to see working SUM formula: `=SUM(D2:D5)`
2. Select cell B9 to see working AVERAGE formula: `=AVERAGE(D2:D5)`
3. Select cell B10 to see working COUNT formula: `=COUNT(D2:D5)`
4. Create your own formulas by typing `=SUM(A1:A5)` in any cell

## 3. Copy/Paste ✅

**Requirement**: Support copying and pasting cell values

**Implementation**:
- ✅ Ctrl+C to copy selected cells or ranges

**How to Test**:
1. Look at left sidebar "Row/Column Operations" section
2. Click "+ Row" to add a new row (watch row count increase)
3. Click "- Row" to remove a row (watch row count decrease)
4. Click "+ Column" to add a new column (scroll to see new column)
5. Click "- Column" to remove a column

## 5. Sorting ✅

**Requirement**: Sort data by column (ascending/descending)

**Implementation**:
- ✅ Column selection dropdown (A-Z columns)
- ✅ Ascending/Descending toggle buttons
- ✅ Sort button to execute sorting
- ✅ Handles both text and numeric data
- ✅ Maintains row integrity during sorting

- `gridSlice.ts` - Added sortData reducer
- `operationsSlice.ts` - Sort state management
- `useSorting.ts` - Sorting logic hook
- `App.tsx` - Integrated sorting controls in sidebar

**How to Test**:
1. Look at left sidebar "Sorting Controls" section
2. Select column "J" from dropdown (contains unsorted numbers: 45, 12, 78, 23, 67)
3. Choose "Asc" or "Desc" order
4. Click "Sort" button
5. Verify column J data is now sorted correctly
